- ⚡ Fun fact: In Legends, Revan was a Jedi Knight who broke away from the Jedi Order, became a Dark Lord of the Sith, and formed a Sith Empire that waged war against the Order and the Galactic Republic. While experiencing amnesia, the former Sith was retrained as a Jedi to confront the Sith Empire, Revan's own creation.
